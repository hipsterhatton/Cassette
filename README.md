# Cassette

Cassette is an OS X desktop application for the internet music radio 8tracks (https://8tracks.com/)

-NOTE- This project is a WIP - and has not been touched for a few years. 8tracks changed their licensing model which means that I'm not able to use the full functionality
because I'm based in the UK

Features:
- Async promise architecture w/ error handling
- Searching 8tracks mixes library via: keywords, tags
- Streaming of songs from a mix, play/pause/fast forward
- User account support: log in, log out, edit account
- CRUD of personal 'collections' (playlist of mixes)
